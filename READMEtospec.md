Backend
Node App

Front End
Still unknown
Make Angular App that uses AJAX

Need API of my design:
- look to other projects
-- think it means to make a data source in json that you can make CRUD actions on
- you interact with it through ajax calls 
- what would your current API be?
- you dont have one
- you just have users
- users is the API
- users will have contacts


What does this mean/look like:
- i am using google maps but it doesnt want that it wants me to store data, host it on backend(?) and then extract it back using AJAX

Need to use Angular
BEGIN

- how do I make this into an angular app
- using directives
- using a viewcontroller
- oh god
-  leave BACK end alone
- angular is all about front end - making small requests on server only for the necessary data 
- aim on angular is to make a more or less one-page app
- majority is thus written in one file - often called index.html
- javascript is abstracted into js
- be careful to split angular correctly within the js folder

- find a good tutorial/completed example
-- criminals one is supposed to be best

FOLLOW THE ORDER 
- make ng app
DONE
- use angular authentication?
- Do i have to - i think so

- dont even have to do authentication is not part of the brief
- add later

- use angular to create an app of my choice
- 3 days
- GO
for a walk
- back now
- enjoy it
- play with it
- learn as quick as possible but fundamentally at your own pace

take working starter code

what is angular - why is it used?
- check your evernotes
