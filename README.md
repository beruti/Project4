Testing Bonzo

Get a map on the page
- make div and then plugin
- done

get map to show a hospital

map now loops through array of hospitals to populate




get forms running that store to database

Patient form
- establish schema
- make form
- make input fields correspond to model
- check it is submitting to route

- what page will lead them to this?
- rendered by route? yes URL route - matches to controller action - controller action should render page
-- is this how it works with html file - should do
- we have been using states in angular but what determined something as the page that is hit when you put in the URL?

GET FULLY FUNCTIONAL SIGN UP WORKING

hosting with python simpleHTTPServer 
- what does this do exactly?
- it doesnt mean that i can access the static pages in my front-end as far as i can see
- how is it working in our angular apps?

-- automatically searching for index.html file?
- one already exists here so why wont it load it?
it will but it has to go into public folder first
- this means sign up should be in an index.html file unless i change the setting of my python server to automatically look for sign up


BUT how to connect this to the back?
- they are not linked at all at the moment
- need to use AJAX potentially
- look for completed example from class - when we first started doing ajax

SO
can load static page
BUT will need ajax request to make a post to ther server - will then have to get/set and remove token etc with sign up in app.js in js on front-end folder





- ticketing form
